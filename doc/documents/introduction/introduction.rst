Overview
========

This is a handbook for ARC labs which is a part of ARC university cour. It's written to
to help students who attened the ARC university courses and anyone who is interested in ARC to
get started in ARC processor development. It describes all the basic elements of ARC labs and
how to finish the labs with step by step approach.

This book can be used as a Lab teaching material for ARC university courses at
undergraduate or graduate level with majors in Commuter Science, Computer
Engineering, Electrical Engineering; or for professional engineers.

This handbook includes 12 labs currently (more labs will be added in the future), which can be
classified into 3 levels:

* Level1: ARC basic

The labs in this level cover the basic topics about ARC, e.g., the installation of tools, hello world, interrupts.

* Level2: ARC advance

The labs in this level cover the advanced topics about ARC, e.g., RTOS, customized linkage.

* Level3: ARC exploaration

The labs in this level will cover some complex applications.

Most of labs are based on the embARC Open Software Platform (OSP) is an open software platform to
facilitate the development of embedded systems based on |arc|.

It is designed to provide a unified platform for |arc| users by defining
consistent and simple software interfaces to the processor and peripherals,
together with ports of several well known FOSS embedded software stacks to
|arc|.
